            <p>The necessity for <strong>PlaszymeDB</strong> stems from two critical shortcomings in the current
                research landscape. Relevant research findings are scattered across various publications and databases,
                creating significant data fragmentation that makes it unduly difficult for researchers to search,
                compare, and apply plastic-degrading enzymes. This necessitates <strong>complex, manual
                    integration</strong> of information that exists in disconnected repositories, raising the <strong>data
                    access threshold</strong> in this field. Compounding this issue, the underlying data points within
                existing repositories often suffer from <strong>inconsistent quality</strong> and <strong>lack of
                    standardization</strong>, meaning the data is not readily usable for advanced computational
                approaches, such as machine learning, without substantial upfront investment in <strong>data
                    curation</strong> and <strong>cleaning</strong>. Researchers urgently need a systematic, interactive
                platform to not only integrate and present this fragmented information but also ensure the <strong>reliability</strong>
                and <strong>standardization</strong> of the data.</p>
            <p>To address this demand, we developed <strong>PlaszymeDB</strong> — a comprehensive and meticulously
                curated database of plastic-degrading enzymes.</p>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                PlaszymeDB aims to provide an open, user-friendly, and sustainably updated resource for researchers worldwide. As a
                comprehensive database dedicated to plastic-degrading enzymes, it includes 474 enzyme records reported
                up to 2025, covering 34 types of plastics (such as PET, PE, PP, and PVC), and integrates
                AlphaFold-predicted structural files along with selected experimentally resolved structures.</p>
            <figure><a
                    href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5580/xjtluaichina2025/assets/images/model/database/db-statistic.webp"><img
                    src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5580/xjtluaichina2025/assets/images/model/database/db-statistic.webp"/></a>
            </figure>
            <p>The database not only provides basic information (e.g., sequence, EC number, host organism) but also
                integrates structural analysis, functional annotations, and phylogenetic insights. Its goal is to enable
                systematic management of plastic-degrading enzymes.</p>
            <h2 id="design-objectives">Design Objectives</h2>
            <p>PlaszymeDB is more than just an information platform — it is closely linked to downstream model
                development. On the one hand, it provides standardized datasets for machine learning model training,
                ensuring accuracy and reliability. On the other hand, in this project, five test sequences used in model
                training were directly screened for wet-lab validation. By combining data-driven approaches with
                experimental confirmation, the database serves as a practical bridge between theoretical research and
                real-world applications.</p>
            <p>PlaszymeDB aims to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide a new integrated data source for researchers worldwide, reducing redundant efforts caused by
                    dispersed information;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Innovatively combine structural data, laying the groundwork for enzyme engineering and environmental
                    remediation;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Supply candidate sequences and annotations for laboratory studies, shortening the path from data to
                    experimental validation;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve as a dataset for artificial intelligence model training;</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower the barrier to data use through open access and interactive design, enabling researchers from
                    diverse backgrounds and disciplines to benefit and fostering global academic exchange and
                    interdisciplinary collaboration.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="overall-workflow">Overall Workflow</h2>
            <p>The construction of PlaszymeDB follows a strict data collection and processing procedure to ensure the
                accuracy and reproducibility of the database content.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
            <p>We integrated enzyme information from PlasticDB (Gambarini et al., 2022), PAZy (Buchholz et al., 2022),
                PMBD (Gan &amp; Zhang, 2019), two open-source GitHub projects (Medina-Ortiz et al., 2025; Zrimec et al.,
                2021), and one relevant research article (Jiang et al., 2023). All collected entries were
                cross-validated with UniProt, NCBI, and PDB to ensure the reliability of existing sequences and
                annotations.</p>
            <h3 id="data-standardization-and-cleaning">Data Standardization and Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Plastic type names were unified, a systematic ID coding scheme was designed, and redundant or anomalous
                sequences were removed to ensure data consistency and scientific value.</p>
            <p>Deduplication was implemented via two approaches:</p>
            <p>
                <li><strong>- Script-based cleaning</strong>
                    <p>By means of a self-developed script, batch processing was carried out through four main
                        steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data preprocessing:</strong> Organize datasets collected from six different sources
                            (the professional databases PlasticDB, PAZy, and PMBD; two open-source GitHub projects; and
                            one research article on plastic-degrading enzymes), ensuring preliminary consistency in
                            field formats and content.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data integration:</strong> Merge datasets by mapping to a unified set of key fields
                            (<code>plastic</code>, <code>label</code>, <code>sequence</code>, <code>genbank_ids</code>,
                            <code>uniprot_ids</code>, <code>pdb_ids</code>, <code>refseq_ids</code>,
                            <code>mgnify_ids</code>, <code>enzyme_name</code>, <code>ec_number</code>,
                            <code>gene_name</code>, <code>host_organism</code>, <code>taxonomy</code>,
                            <code>reference</code>, <code>source_name</code>), resulting in a comprehensive integrated
                            dataset.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sequence completion:</strong> For entries lacking sequence information, retrieve the
                            missing sequences using available ID data via external database APIs, in the order of
                            UniProt → GenBank → PDB → RefSeq, thereby minimizing missing values.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deduplication and quality control:</strong> Remove records without any sequence
                            information. Perform deduplication using <code>["plastic", "label", "sequence"]</code> as a
                            composite key; entries are merged only if plastic type, sample label (positive/negative),
                            and sequence are completely identical. In addition, standardize and merge synonymous plastic
                            names, check field formats and fill missing values, and validate sequence quality (retaining
                            only standard amino acid letters while discarding sequences containing non-standard
                            characters, low-complexity regions, or abnormal lengths).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li><strong>- Manual curation</strong>
                    <p>Suspect entries flagged by scripts (e.g., ambiguous synonyms, anomalous EC numbers, host names
                        with misspellings or incorrect Latin formatting, broken references, or invalid database links)
                        were manually verified by cross-checking original publications against UniProt, NCBI, and PDB
                        records.</p></li>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the process, all operations were logged, and version updates were documented to form a
                complete audit trail. The combination of “scripted automation + manual curation” enhanced both
                efficiency and reliability.</p>
            <h3 id="information-integration">Information Integration</h3><h4><strong>Functional Annotation</strong></h4>
            <p>The database includes enzyme annotations such as EC numbers, plastic degradation relationships, and host
                organisms. Annotations were supplemented according to data availability, which refers to the varying
                richness of information across database records and literature. Wherever possible, PlaszymeDB enriched
                incomplete entries with additional references.</p><h4><strong>Structural Information</strong></h4>
            <p>For every protein entry, PlaszymeDB provides predicted 3D structures generated by AlphaFold (developed by
                DeepMind). In addition, some entries include high-resolution structures determined experimentally via
                X-ray crystallography, serving as critical validation for predictions.</p>
            <p>By integrating experimental and computational structures, PlaszymeDB offers a panoramic resource for
                investigating enzyme features and mechanisms.</p>
            <p>The following structural files are selected from PlaszymeDB, providing a visual representation of the
                protein sequence structure:</p>

            <h4><strong>Source Tracing</strong></h4>
            <p>PlaszymeDB establishes a systematic traceability mechanism for every protein entry:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Database links:</strong> Direct connections to UniProt, NCBI, and PDB enable quick
                    verification of original data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research references:</strong> Each entry is accompanied by citation information, ensuring
                    annotation credibility and respect for intellectual property.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This combination of database links and literature validation enhances both the credibility and
                accessibility of the resource.</p>
            <h3 id="quality-assurance-and-review">Quality Assurance and Review</h3>
            <p>All entries were cross-validated with UniProt, NCBI, and PDB to ensure sequence and annotation
                reliability. Final review followed a “two reviewers plus one arbitrator” system: two curators
                independently assessed the data; if they agreed, the result was confirmed; in case of disagreement, a
                third reviewer arbitrated through discussion to finalize the decision.</p>
            <h3 id="biological-validation-and-phylogenetic-analysis">Biological Validation and Phylogenetic
                Analysis</h3><h4><strong>Wet-lab Validation</strong></h4>
            <p>To verify that representative enzymes within the database exhibit true degradation activity, <strong>five
                enzyme sequences were selected through stratified sampling</strong> that balanced enzyme family
                diversity and plastic substrate types.</p>
            <p>The corresponding genes were cloned into <strong>pET expression vectors</strong> and heterologously
                expressed in <em>E. coli</em> via the <strong>pelB signal peptide pathway</strong>.</p>
            <p>Protein expression was confirmed using <strong>SDS-PAGE</strong> and <strong>Western blot</strong>,
                followed by <strong>activity assays</strong> with model substrates representing <strong>ester-bond and
                    polyester hydrolysis</strong>. All selected enzymes displayed measurable activity compared with
                negative controls, confirming that <strong>database entries correspond to biologically functional
                    proteins</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote><a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='overview') }}">View wet-lab validation details</a></blockquote>
            <h4><strong>Bioinformatic
                Validation</strong></h4>
            <p>In parallel, all enzyme sequences were standardized, de-duplicated, and annotated using
                <strong>Pfam</strong> and <strong>InterPro</strong> domain analyses. Representative sequences were
                aligned via <strong>MUSCLE</strong>, and <strong>phylogenetic trees</strong> were constructed using the
                <strong>Maximum Likelihood</strong> method.</p>
            <p>Results were visualized on <strong>iTOL</strong>, where color-coded clades represent different plastic
                types and enzyme families. The resulting tree shows that <strong>α/β-hydrolases dominate the
                    dataset</strong>, with distinct subgroups corresponding to <strong>cutinase-like</strong> and
                <strong>lipase-like</strong> families, in line with known literature on polyester degradation
                mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>PlaszymeDB</strong> establishes a high-quality, continuously curated foundation for global
                research on plastic-degrading enzymes.</p>
            <p>By integrating sequence data, structural information, phylogenetic relationships, and functional
                annotations — and validating selected entries through <strong>wet-lab enzymatic assays</strong> and
                <strong>bioinformatic analyses</strong> — the database ensures both <strong>computational
                    accuracy</strong> and <strong>biological reliability</strong>.</p>
            <p>To promote open science and reproducibility, PlaszymeDB has been packaged and archived following iGEM’s
                FAIR data standards, and the full dataset has been publicly deposited on <strong>Zenodo (DOI:
                    10.5281/zenodo.17257278)</strong> for long-term accessibility and citation.</p>
            <p>As an open-access platform freely available at <strong><a href="http://plaszyme.org/plaszymedb/V9.html">PlaszymeDB</a></strong>,
                it enables researchers from diverse backgrounds to search, compare, and apply enzyme data seamlessly,
                supporting downstream applications in synthetic biology, enzyme engineering, and environmental
                biotechnology.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, PlaszymeDB is not merely a data repository but a living infrastructure that bridges data,
                experiments, and computational discovery, catalyzing innovation toward a sustainable and AI-empowered
                future in biodegradation research.</p>
